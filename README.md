Systems of coupled oscillators or individuals interacting on networks can exhibit rich emergent behaviors such as synchronization, phase locking and consensus or polarization of opinions. Such emergent behavior depends on network topology, the governing dynamics, and initial condition, often in a highly non-linear way. Understanding patterns of how such large-scale behavior emerges is of critical importance, which has led to numerous applications in coordination of fleets of autonomous vehicles, information fusion, wireless sensor networks, distributed computing systems, and modeling formation of public opinions in social networks. There has been recent works utilizing machine-learning based methods to better understand how various large-scale behavior emerges in complex systems, which is often mathematically intractable without special symmetries. In this work, we propose to utilize an interpretable unsupervised feature extraction method of *nonnegative CP tensor decomposition* (NCPD) to **extract key spatiotemporal patterns of emergence at subgraph level**. That is, we seek to learn a few snapshots of dynamics on certain subgraph patterns and their temporal evolution by using NCPD. We study the *firefly cellular automata* (FCA) of discrete pulse-coupled oscillators and *Hegselmann-Krause* (HK) model for opinion dynamics on synthetic networks generated by the Newman-Watts-Strogatz (NWS) model and the Barab√°si-Albert (BA) networks.
